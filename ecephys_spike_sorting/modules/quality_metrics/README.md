# Quality Metrics

Computes quality metrics for sorted units. Similar to the `mean_waveforms` module, this module can calculate metrics separately for individual epochs. If no epochs are specified, metrics are computed for the entire recording.

## Included Metrics

### A Note on Calculations

For metrics based on waveform principal components (isolation distance, L-ratio, _d'_, and nearest neighbors hit rate and false alarm rate), it is typical to compute the metrics for all pairs of units and report the "worst-case" value. We have found that this tends to under- or over-estimate the degree of contamination when there are large firing rate differences between pairs of units that are being compared. Instead, we compute metrics by sub-selecting spikes from _all_ other units on the same set of channels, which seems to give a more accurate picture of isolation quality. We would appreciate feedback on whether this approach makes sense.


## Running

```
python -m ecephys_spike_sorting.modules.quality_metrics --input_json <path to input json> --output_json <path to output json>
```
Two arguments must be included:
1. The location of an existing file in JSON format containing a list of paths and parameters.
2. The location to write a file in JSON format containing information generated by the module while it was run.

See the `_schemas.py` file for detailed information about the contents of the input JSON.


## Input data

- **Kilosort outputs** : includes spike times, spike clusters, cluster quality, etc.


## Output data
